## Overview

### Description

Allows users to log their current mood throughout the day and write notes about the reasons why their emotions have been affected. Moods can be logged and stored in chronological order.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**  Health & Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Mobile use allows the user to update their mood as it happens and whenever they feel their emotions. Having a mobile app makes it better to accurately log their moods.
- **Story:** Users are encouraged to tune in and reflect on their moods throughout the day. This will help them exercise self-reflection and awareness which can improve overall mood and mental health.
- **Market:** Anyone would would like to improve their mental/emotional health by practicing awareness.
- **Habit:** A few times a day depending how often the user's mood changes and how often they want to journal about their feelings.
- **Scope:** Medium difficulty app because I would like to implement notifications as well to "check-in" on the user and remind them to take a break from their day and log their moods. Other than that, the UI is simple and most of the app is simplified and can store information.
